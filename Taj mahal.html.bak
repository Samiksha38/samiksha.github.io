--History--
<br>
It is generally accepted that Agra was both an ancient city from the times of the Mahabharata (see above)
and yet nevertheless Sultan Sikandar Lodī, the Muslim ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, founded Agra in the year
1504. After the Sultan’s death, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibrāhīm Lodī. He ruled his Sultanate 
from Agra until he fell fighting to Mughal Badshah (emperor) Bābar in the First battle of Panipat fought in 
1526.
The golden age of the city began with the Mughals. It was known then as Akbarabād and remained the capital of 
the Mughal Empire under the Badshahs (emperors) Akbar, Jahāngīr and Shāh Jahān. Akbar made it the eponymous 
seat of one of his original twelve subahs (imperial top-level provinces), bordering (Old) Delhi, Awadh (Oudh), 
Allahabad, Malwa and Ajmer subahs. Shāh Jahān later shifted his capital to Shāhjahānabād in the year 1649.
Since Akbarabād was one of the most important cities in India under the Mughals, it witnessed a lot of building
 activity. Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of 
 river Yamuna. The garden is called the Arām Bāgh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson Akbar the Great 
 raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce 
 and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarabād called Fatehpūr Sikrī. This city was 
 built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.
